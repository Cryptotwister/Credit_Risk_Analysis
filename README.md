# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

FastLending is a peer to peer lending services company wants to use machine learning to predict credit risk.
Management believes that this will provide a quicker and more reliable loan experience. Furthermore, they also believe that machine learning will lead to a more accurate identification of good candidates for loans which will lead to lower default rates.
The purpose of this project is to assist Fastlending's lead data scientist in implementing this plan by building and evaluating several machine learning models or algorithms to predict credit risk.
The techniques used to achieve this include resampling and boosting as part of the project.
Once designed, the project called for us to evaluate the performance of these models and make a written recommendation on whether these models should be used to predict credit risk.

## Results:

### Deliverable 1: Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk

### Deliverable 2: Use the SMOTEENN algorithm to Predict Credit Risk

### Deliverable 3: Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk
