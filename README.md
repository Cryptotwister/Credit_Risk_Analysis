# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

FastLending is a peer to peer lending services company that wants to use machine learning to predict credit risk.
Management believes that this will provide a quicker and more reliable loan experience. Furthermore, they also believe that machine learning will lead to a more accurate identification of good candidates for loans which will lead to lower default rates.
The purpose of this project is to assist Fastlending's lead data scientist in implementing this plan by building and evaluating several machine learning models or algorithms to predict credit risk.
The techniques used to achieve this include resampling and boosting as part of the project.
Once designed, we need to evaluate the performance of these models and make a written recommendation on whether these models should be used to predict credit risk.

## Results:
The code for the machine learning algortithms can be found in the jupyter notebook files: [credit_risk_resampling](https://github.com/Cryptotwister/Credit_Risk_Analysis/blob/main/credit_risk_resampling.ipynb)
and [credit_risk_ensemble](https://github.com/Cryptotwister/Credit_Risk_Analysis/blob/main/credit_risk_ensemble.ipynb).

In the cource of the project we developed the follwing mashine learning models:

* Naive Random Oversampling;
* SMOTE Oversampling;
* Undersampling;
* SMOTEENN algorithm - Combination (Over and Under) Sampling;
* Ensemble Classifier - Balanced Random Forest;
* Ensemble Classifier - Easy Ensemble.
